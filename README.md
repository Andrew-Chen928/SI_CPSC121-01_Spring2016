Content of SI session

Base on the experience before, I plan to give you more practice during SI sessions. It will include some questions related to lectures and simple projects to make sure you got the concept to support your next semester in 131. If enough people show up, group study will be the best choice.

Midterm & Final week

The SI session will not be canceled on midterm or final week. I am willing to answer your questions or help you to prepare the exam.

Feel free to come anytime and bring all your questions to SI sessions. If the schedule doesn't match yours, email me to find an available time or we have another SI leader Sonal who's SI sessions are MW 1:00–2:15pm in CS 306.
